Okay, so! I think you started with squares to make a gradient blue background, 
then added a series of ovals to make hills that also looked like gradients, 
covered it with a series of Big ovals to make a foreground, 
then added irregular rectangles and triangles to make trees, 
and more ovals in white (and crossed over one another) to make clouds.

I think your English instructions do convey the finished work

I've never been great with the art end of it, so I probably would've done exactly what you did, except with fewer colors and probably very stick-straight trees
