# Imgd-5010-Assignment-2-Instructions-Thomas-Jolicoeur

## Initial instructions
My inital design was to have p5js create a simple landscape using circles and squares and trangles to form the details such as trees lakes and hills

- First drawing the background 
- Second defining the lake/horizon of the image from the sky
- Third creating the hills themsleves
- Fourth creating trees and other details such as clouds
- Fifth Shade the land
- Sixth if done correctly it should hopefully draw a simple landscape that remains stationary
